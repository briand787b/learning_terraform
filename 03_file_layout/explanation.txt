* Keeping all infrastucture configuration in one folder or terraform file makes every
part of the infrastucture vulnerable to breakage every time any part of the infrastructure
is updated.
* To avoid this, keep every part of the infrastructure that can be isolated in its own
directory, thus with its own state file.
* Guideline:
    a) Isolate by environment (staging, production, etc)
    b) Isolate by component (vpc, services, databases)

* Each folder will also contain organized terraform configuration files:
    a) vars.tf - Input variables
    b) outputs.tf - Output variables
    c) main.tf - The actual resources
